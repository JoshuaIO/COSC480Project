Dependencies and Steps
	Project Link: https://github.com/JoshuaIO/COSC480Project

1. To run this project, it’s best to download IntelliJ IDE which can be found here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

2. Once Intellij is downloaded, you would be asked to download JDK version 11.

3. You would also need to download Maven dependencies from Intellj to run the project

4. Finally, make sure when you clone the GitHub repository, open the demo file in IntelliJ.

5. Make sure the pom.xml file, matches the dependencies listed above.

6. Setup a database with the fields for userid, firstname, lastname, email, username,password,email.

7. This is needed for queries. To edit the database, navigate to demo>src>resources>application.properties.

 When running the file makesure to run the program from\demo\demo\src\main\java\apex\example\demo\ApexdemoApplication
This should run springBoot with the springboot dependency from pom.xml

The webserver will be started on a port from tomcat, and from there you would just need to visit the http link on your web browser!
Goal
The goal of the project is to give an example of frontend and backend linkage with RDBMS, allowing insight into how apex finance was going to function. On successful registration, you will be sent to a dashboard that is still a work in progress, along with the data being saved in the RDBMS. Apex Finance’s backend programming shows the benefits of spring-boot compared to express, allowing multithreaded performance, fast compilation, and many other benefits. This leads my team to continue developing the project.
